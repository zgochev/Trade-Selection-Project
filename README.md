# Trade_Selection_Project
An illustration of an end-to-end machine learning workflow 
## Overview
The data was created by an export script in Tradestation Development Environment. Trades were generated intraday in 24 futures markets in 6 distinct sectors (see data dictionary file). Each trade has a profit target and a stop loss targeting 1 to 1 risk/reward so the cost/benefit of correctly classifying a trade as winner/loser are roughly symmetrical.
